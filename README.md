# Test-Pattern-Generation-System
An end-to-end C++ framework for test-pattern generation (ATPG) and fault simulation, targeting high fault coverage with reduced runtime and pattern count. Added and compared heuristics: multi-variant Random TPG, D-frontier selection (level/SCOAP-guided), SCOAP-based justification/backtrace, fault-ordering strategies, and simple X-fill compression.
